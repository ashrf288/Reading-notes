## Control flow
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

**Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line**

## 1- `if...else`

The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy. If the condition is falsy, another statement can be executed.

`if (condition) {`

 `  statement1`

`} else {`

  ` statement2`

`}`

## 2-break

The break statement terminates the current loop,

`break [label];`
