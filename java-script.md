# java script


## programming language we use make the website intractive (dynamic).

 JavaScript's syntax **expressions** and **operators**, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary and more.

##  Operators
JavaScript has the following types of operators:
+ Assignment operators   **For** example  `3+4 or x*y.`
+ Comparison operators    **For** example  `x = y `
+ Arithmetic operators    **For** example  `(+), subtraction (-)multiplication`
+ Bitwise operators       **For** example  `a & b`
+ Logical operators       **For** example  `&& and ||`
+ String operators        **For** example  `'my ' + 'string'`
 + Conditional (ternary) operator    **For** example  `condition ? val1 : val2`
 + Comma operator   **For**   evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand
+  Unary operators   **For** example `delete` `typeof`
+ Relational operators   **For** example  `in`  `instanceof`


 ## Operator precedence
The precedence of operators determines the order they are applied when evaluating an expression. You can override operator precedence by using parentheses.

 ## Expressions
An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

 **For** example  : `x = 7` .

 ## Adding Strings and Numbers:
 Example:
`var x = 5 + 5;`

## Control flow
The control flow is the **order** in which the computer executes statements in a script.

 Code is run in order from the **first** line in the file to the **last** line, **unless** the computer runs across the **(extremely frequent)** structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

  including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.
