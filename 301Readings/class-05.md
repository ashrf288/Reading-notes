# Thinking in React

## HOw would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?

1- Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

2- Build A Static Version in React

3-Identify  Representation Of UI State

4-Identify Where Your State Should Live

5-Add Inverse Data Flow


## What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
 a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.


 ## What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

  has no interactivity( building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.)

## once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
 Add the  Data Flow ( support data flowing the other way)


 ## What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

 **Is it passed in from a parent via props?**
  If so, it probably isn’t state.

Does it remain unchanged over time?

 **If so, it probably isn’t state.**

Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? 
**If so, it isn’t state.**

## How can you identify where state needs to live?

1- Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
2- Find a common owner component
