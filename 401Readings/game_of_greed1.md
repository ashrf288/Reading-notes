# random module in Python

provides access to functions that support many operations.

## Random functions


**1-Randint**

 (If we wanted a random integer)

accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between them

```
import random
print random.randint(0, 5) // This will output either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5
```
**2-Random**
(to get larger numbers)

```
import random
random.random() * 100
```
**3-Choice**
(Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.)

```
import random
myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
random.choice(myList)
```
**4-Shuffle**
( shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order)

```
from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)
Output:
# print x  gives  [[9], [2], [7], [0], [4], [5], [3], [1], [8], [6]]
```

**5-Randrange**
(Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step))

**random.randrange(start, stop[, step])**
```

import random
for i in range(3):
    print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)
```


 # Risk Analysis

 + Why use Risk Analysis?

1- highlights the potential problem areas. 

2-helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks.

## unavoidable.  risks

## there are certain risks that are unavoidable. 
ex : The time that you allocated for testing

**you have to tackle the situation with care.**
steps:
1-Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting

2-Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas

3- Create a Risk Assessment database for future use

4- Identify and notice the **risk magnitude indicators**: high, medium, low.

## Risk Identification:

+ Business Risks: It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

+ Testing Risks

+ Premature Release Risk: analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

+ Software Risks: risks associated with the software development process.


## Risk Assessment
( assessment has to be dealt programmatically)
+ **Effect**  determine the  impact of the action 

+ **Cause** Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that

+ **Likelihood** there is a probability that a requirement wonâ€™t be satisfied.

## How to perform Risk Analysis?
1-Searching the risk

2- Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

3- Measures for the risk identified


## TestCoverage  
 (also called code coverage)

  Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase.

  **high coverage numbers are too easy to reach with low quality testing.**

  ** TDD is a very useful, but certainly not sufficient, **


  **I would expect a coverage percentage in the upper 80s or 90s. I would be suspicious of anything like 100%**



  **The reason  why people focus on coverage numbers is because they want to know if they are testing enough. **

  **low coverage numbers, say below half, are a sign of `trouble`. But high numbers don't necessarily mean much, and lead to `ignorance-promoting dashboards`.** 


  **You are testing too much if you can remove tests while still having enough.**


  **You can always move slow tests to a later stage in your deployment pipeline, or even pull them out of the pipeline and run them periodically.**

  ## how to calculate big O
1- different steps get add (ex:  loops )
2- drop constants( there is no 2n or 3n only powers of n)
3- different parts have different names
4- drop non domenant term
